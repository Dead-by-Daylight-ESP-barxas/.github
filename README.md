# Dead by Daylight ESP – Full Vision, Full Control 👁️💀

## What You Can’t See Will Kill You… Unless You Can 👀

*Dead by Daylight* is all about stealth, strategy, and split-second decisions. But when you can't see your teammates, the killer’s lurking nearby, and the last gen is hiding behind a shack — it turns into a guessing game. That's where **Dead by Daylight ESP** comes in hot 💡

ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) is a cheat that shows you **everything** in real time: players, items, generators, hatches, totems, you name it. Survivors become ghosts with X-ray outlines, killers can’t sneak, and objectives are always in view.

## 🎮 What Is ESP in DBD?

**ESP** is a visual overlay that gives you complete map awareness by highlighting:

* All **players** (survivors or killer)
* All **objectives** (gens, hatches, doors, totems)
* Real-time **action info** (healing, crouching, chasing, hooking)
* Optional **item** and **loot tracking**

Unlike perks or built-in aura-reading, this doesn’t require any in-game unlocks — it’s on *all the time* 💥
